    <h1>What is Bootstrap?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development</li>
        <li>Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins</li>
        <li>Bootstrap also givese you the ability to easily create responsive designs.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h1>Bootstrap History</h1>
    <p>Bootstrap was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter, and released as an open source product in August 2011 on Github.</p>
    <p><b>In June 2014 Bootstrap was the No.1 project on Github!</b></p>
    <hr/>
    <h1>Why Use Bootstrap?</h1>
    <p>Advantages of Bootstrap:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Easy to use: </b>Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap</li>
        <li><b>Responsive features: </b>Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops</li>
        <li><b>Mobile-first approach: </b>In Bootstrap 3, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework</li>
        <li><b>Browser compatibility: </b>Bootstrap is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera)</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h1>Where to Get Bootstrap?</h1>
    <p>There are two ways to start using Bootstrap on your own web site.</p>
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Download Bootstrap from getbootstrap.com</li>
        <li>Include Bootstrap from a CDN</li>
    </ul>
    <hr/>
    <h1>Downloading Bootstrap</h1>
    <p>if you want to download and host Bootstrap youtself, go to <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">getbootstrap.com</a>, and follow the instruction there.</p>
    <hr/>
    <hr/>
    <h1>Bootstrap CDN</h1>
    <p>If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).</p>
    <p>MaxCDN provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. You must also include jQuery.</p>
    <blockquote style="background-color: rgba(255,255,0,0.22)">
        <p><b>One advantage of using the Bootstrap CDN:</b></p>
        <p>Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap from MaxCDN when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><b>jQuery</b></p>
        <p>Bootstrap uses jQuery for JavaScript plugins (like modals, tooltips, etc). However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need jQuery.</p>

    <h1>Create First Web Page With Bootstrap</h1>
    <p><b>1. Add the HTML5 doctype</b></p>
    <p>Bootstrap uses HTML elements and CSS properties that require the HTML5 doctype.</p>
    <p>Always include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along with the lang attribute and the correct character set.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><b>2. Bootstrap 3 is mobile-first</b></p>
    <p>Bootstrap 3 is designed to be responsive to mobile devices. Mobile-first styles are part of the core framework.</p>
    <p>To ensure proper rendering and t ouch zooming, add the folloing <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element.</p>
    <p>The <code>width=device-width</code> part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).</p>
    <p>The <code>initial-scale=1</code> part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.</p>
    <br/>
    <p><b>3. Containers</b></p>
    <p>Bootstrap also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.</p>
    <p>There are two container classes to choose from:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none">
        <li>1. The <code>.container</code> class provides a responsive <b>fixed width container</b></li>
        <li>2. The <code>.container-fluid</code> class provides a <b>full width container, </b> spanning the entire width of the viewport</li>
    </ul>

            <p>This is some text.</p>
        </div>
